# TV Shows React App

This React JS application was given me for assignment . It utilizes the TVMaze API to create a two-screen application for displaying information about TV shows.

## Features

- **Dynamic Data:** Utilizes the TVMaze API to fetch and display information about TV shows.
- **Two Screens:** The application features two screens:
  1. **Show List:** Displays a list of show names along with additional details such as language, genres, and ratings.
  2. **Show Summary:** Shows the detailed summary of the selected show and allows users to book movie tickets.

- **Booking Functionality:** The second screen includes a button to book a movie ticket, which opens a form with the movie name pre-filled and relevant details.

- **Local/Session Storage:** User details entered in the form are stored in local/session storage, preventing unnecessary page reloads.

- **UI/UX Design:** Incorporates a clean and visually appealing user interface using basic React JS . Tailwind is used for additional styling.

- **Proper Component Structure:** Follows a well-organized React component file structure for modularity and maintainability.
